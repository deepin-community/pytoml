Description: TOML parser and emitter for Python3
 This project aims at being a specs-conforming and strict parser and writer
 for TOML files. The library currently supports version 0.4.0 of the specs.
 .
 TOML aims to be a minimal configuration file format that is easy to read
 due to obvious semantics. It is designed to map unambiguously to a hash
 table and it is easy to parse into data structures in a wide variety of
 languages.
 .
 This package contains the module for Python3 and runs with >= 3.4.
